# Are Almost Equal - Python Solution  

## Description  
This Python program checks whether two strings are **almost equal**. Two strings are considered almost equal if we can make them identical by swapping **exactly one pair of characters** in one of the strings.  

## How It Works  
The solution follows these steps:  
1. If `s1` and `s2` are already equal, return `True` since no swap is needed.  
2. Identify the positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ and store them in a list (`diff`).  
3. If there are exactly **two** differences, check if swapping those characters makes the strings equal.  
4. If so, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.  

## Code  
```python
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        # If the strings are already equal, no swap is needed
        if s1 == s2:
            return True

        # Find the positions where the characters differ
        diff = [(a, b) for a, b in zip(s1, s2) if a != b]

        # To be almost equal, there should be exactly 2 differences, and they should be swappable
        return len(diff) == 2 and diff[0] == diff[1][::-1]

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.areAlmostEqual("bank", "kanb"))  # Output: True
print(solution.areAlmostEqual("attack", "defend"))  # Output: False
print(solution.areAlmostEqual("abcd", "abdc"))  # Output: True
print(solution.areAlmostEqual("abcdefghijklmnop", "aaadefghijklmnop"))  # Output: False
```

## Explanation with Examples  
| Example | `s1` | `s2` | Output | Explanation |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ | `"bank"` | `"kanb"` | `True` | Swapping `'b'` and `'k'` in `"bank"` makes `"kanb"`, which matches `s2`. |
| ‚ùå | `"attack"` | `"defend"` | `False` | More than one swap would be needed. |
| ‚úÖ | `"abcd"` | `"abdc"` | `True` | Swapping `'c'` and `'d'` makes the strings equal. |
| ‚ùå | `"abcdefghijklmnop"` | `"aaadefghijklmnop"` | `False` | More than two differences exist. |

## Complexity Analysis  
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** ‚Äì We iterate through the strings once to compare characters.  
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** ‚Äì We store at most two character differences.  

## Edge Cases Considered  
- Identical strings (`s1 == s2`)  
- Strings with more than two differences  
- Strings with only one difference  
- Strings of different lengths (not needed in this problem since input constraints assume equal length)  

## Usage  
This solution can be used in scenarios where we need to determine whether two strings can be made equal with a single swap, such as:  
- Spell-checking or typo detection  
- Validating small string modifications  
- Comparing similar user inputs
